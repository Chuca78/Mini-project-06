# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This is the mini project 06 for the UT Austin coding boot camp. For this project I was not given any starter code, instead I created all code from scratch. This project creates a weather application that shows the users current and forecast weather using geo-location, it default to Charlotte, NC if it is unable to retrieve user's location. The application uses an event listener and input fields to update the desired weather location. Using the geo-location, default location, or input location the weather application interfaces with openweather map's API to retrieve weather conditions for the user. This website is designed to show my proficiency in building code from scratch to satisfy the user story and acceptance criteria.

## Usage

The user story is a traveler wants to be able to view weather details for multiple cities of their choosing. The weather application uses the user's geo-location to give them the current weather where they are currently. The user can then enter any city of their choosing to see current and forecasted weather.
